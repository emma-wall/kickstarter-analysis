# Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Overview of Project
This analysis uses excel to identify trends for starting a successful kickstarter campaign using data from over 4000 multi-industry campaigns in various countries. Add findings

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to find the best time of year to launch a campaign and an ideal fundraising goal for a theatre campaign.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
To find the optimal time of year to launch a theatre campaign, I used a pivot table to extract the number of successful, failed and canceled outcomes sorted by the month they were launched. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
To determine a fundraising goal, I looked at the number of successful, failed and cancelled play outcomes based on fundraising goal, breaking up the fundraising goals into increments of $5,000. Using the COUNTIFS formula, I filtered for the data for the specific goal increments, outcome type and category. 

### Challenges and Difficulties 
To avoid typo’s in the code, I automated the process by adding the outcome types and goal increments to rows and columns outside the table and anchored those values. So instead of typing “FORMULA” I just copied and pasted the below into all the cells. 


## Results
* From the graph of Outcomes Based on Launch Date it appears that the best time of year to start a theatre campaign is May. From the graph it looks like the most campaigns we’re started in May, I looked at the percentage of successful outcomes. From the below chart it appears that the May is in fact the best time of year to start a theatre campaign, with XX% of campaign being successful. The worst time of year to start one is December, with only XX amount of campaigns being successful. 
* Looking at our Outcomes Based on Goals Chart, it looks like XYZ
*One limitation I found with this dataset is that it did not encompass method of funding raising. I would think the method of fundraising would be an important aspect to look at when starting a campaign and knowing what fundraising strategies worked the best. 
* For a more complete and through analysis,
